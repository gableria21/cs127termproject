<b> CS127-8 AM2 | COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 2 üíª</b> 

### ü•° Description:

The first-year coding class for the CS127 term project is named Kainan ni Mang Hulyo. 

Food Ordering System is an application that will help restaurants to optimize and control their restaurants. For the waiters, it is making life easier because they don‚Äôt have to go to the kitchen and give orders to the chef easily. From the management point of view, the manager will be able to control the restaurant by having all the reports on hand and being able to see the records of each employee and order.
This application helps restaurants to do all functionalities more accurately and faster. The Food Ordering System reduces manual work and improves the efficiency of restaurants. 

This application is helping Food Orderings to maintain the stock and cash flows and there are many more functionalities, like:
<ul>
‚Ä¢ To store records. <br>
‚Ä¢ Control orders and services. <br>
‚Ä¢ Billings. <br>
‚Ä¢ Control staff and their shifting. <br>
</ul>

The main goal is to maintain the restaurant‚Äôs functions in an effective and accurate manner, and it is reducing the use of manual entries. This software helps food orders to maintain day-to-day records in the system. It is keeping a proper record of the database.

Talking about the features of the food ordering system, the user must select any of the items from the main menu. Then he/she must select its types and then enter the food quantity. After this, the system will ask if the customer is a senior citizen to get a discount and after the question is answered, the system will display the total bill of the customer. The Food Ordering system is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables that have been tackled in CS127 for the development of this project.

### üçï Scope:

The topic we used in making this term project are the following: 

‚Ä¢ <b> Arrays </b> are used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. And we used this array on the card number, total order for the bill, and order quantity.

‚Ä¢ <b> Pointer </b> is a variable that holds the address of another variable. They have data types just like variables, wherein as you can see in our term project an integer type pointer can hold the address of an integer variable and a character type pointer can hold the address of a char variable.

‚Ä¢ <b> Dynamic Arrays </b> is an array with a big improvement, automatic resizing. 

‚Ä¢ One limitation of arrays is that they're fixed size, meaning you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time. Just like in the picture below:

</p>

‚Ä¢ C-String A valid C string requires the presence of a terminating "null character" just like in our code below

</p>

‚Ä¢ <b> Structure </b> is a collection of variables of different data types under a single name. It is similar to a class in that, both hold a collection of data of different data types.

</p>

‚Ä¢ <b> File Streaming File </b> represents storage medium for storing data or information. Streams refer to sequence of bytes. In Files we store data like text or binary data permanently and use these data to read or write in the form of input output operations by transferring bytes of data. 

In our project we used ofstream and fstream, ofstream represents output Stream and this is used for writing in files. While fstream represents both output Stream and input Stream. so it can read from files and write to files.
